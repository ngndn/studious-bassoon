  Provided with a data set of word counts for review texts, we develop a
  framework to accurately predict positive review votes and identify highly
  rated reviews.  Given these two tasks, we optimize our models for both
  problems by evaluating performance characteristics on growing subsets of
  top-$k$ features.

  We select subsets of features using univariate statistical tests before
  fitting our models and compare our results to two naive baselines.  In case of
  the regression problem, our implementation significantly outperforms the
  baseline.  However, for the classification task we show that more advanced
  models barely beat the naive baseline.
