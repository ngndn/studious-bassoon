\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:one}

We are provided with two data sets from Yelp\furl{https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge}. One is for regression task. The other one is for classification. Both are reviews that have been transformed into word counts vector by Bag-of-Words model. There are 50 features in each word counts vector. 

In regression task, we predict the number of positive votes for a review given a word counts. For classification task, we use word counts vector to distinguish (binary) labels for low ($\leq 3$) and high ($>3$ stars) rating of reviews.

Given the large number of features, we also apply feature selection methods. Different techniques are used for the different tasks.

For both task, we try to overcome the naive baseline with simple approaches before using a more complicated one. After all, we can surpass the naive baseline with simple models, except for classification.

The methods and experiments are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:two}
and~\ref{sec:three} respectively.

A complete list of all the features used for each task is
detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:feature-list}.
