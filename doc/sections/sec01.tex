\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:one}

Paragraphs detailing the regression and classification problems, as well as an
overview of the Yelp data set go here.

We implement feature selection methods, regression and classification algorithms
to produce accurate predictions for the Yelp data set.  The methods and
experiments are detailed in Section~\ref{sec:two} and \ref{sec:three}
respectively.  A complete list of all the features used for each task is
detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:feature-list}.
