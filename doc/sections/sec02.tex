\section{Methods}
\label{sec:two}

We employ multiple different methods for the problems of feature selection,
regression and classification.  All methods are tested against a baseline, which
is given by the mean (argue).

\subsection{Feature Selection}

Select features based on highest scores:

\begin{itemize}
\item f\_regression (F-value between label/feature for regression tasks)
\item chi2 (Chi-squared stats of non-negative features for classification tasks)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Regression}

Here, we implement linear regression with gradient descent and polynomial
regression for a degree of 2.

\subsection{Classification}

KNN and then some.
