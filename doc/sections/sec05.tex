\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:five}

Given two tasks with Yelp data set, we successfully apply machine learning to solve them. We work through the standard machine learning pipeline, going from feature selection, determining hyper-parameters for model, choosing model, and apply final model on the test data.

With feature selection, we are able to select the features which correlated with the outcome for regression task, or have a high discriminate power for classification task. For both task, we find that a small number of features are enough to achieve the desired result.

For regression task, we have overcome the baseline using polynomial regression with degree two by a significant margin. We also surpass the baseline in classification task with random forest. However, the performance is just a little bit better than baseline.

We also develop a configurable and extendable framework which can be used for developing and reporting on future learning machine project.
